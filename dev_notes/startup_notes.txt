a). cd to $VRGAL and type 'ng serve --host 0.0.0.0'.  This will start the main angular SPA on
port 4200

b) Start the express server.  cd to $VRGAL and run from the root directory:

nodemon servers/data-examples/index2.js 

This will be port 3002.  It's the data server that updates the files in the git repo

c) Start the the rails server.  cd to $VRZSRV and run

rails s

This will start on port 3002, and the server interfaces with the meta-data in the mysql server.
