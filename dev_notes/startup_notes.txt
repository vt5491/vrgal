ng2 server: 4200
rails server: 3000
express server: 3002

1) How to startup a full environment (including the admin server)

a). cd to $VRGAL and type 'ng serve --aot --environment=sea --host 0.0.0.0'.  This will start the main angular SPA on
port 4200

Note: use ec2 for when running on AWS.

Note: don't use --aot, if doing admin e.g. lifts (get a compiler not loaded error for some reason).

(black on white console)

b) Start the express server.  cd to $VRGAL and run from the root directory:
(in black on yellow console)

nodemon servers/data-examples/index2.js 

This will be port 3002.  It's the data server that updates the files in the git repo

Only need this if running in admin mode.

c) Start the the rails server.  cd to $VRZSRV and run
(green on black console):

rails s

This will start on port 3000, and the server interfaces with the meta-data in the mysql server.

d) Startup the meta-data proxy server:
i)cd to $VRGAL root
ii) startup with node (or nodemon if developing) 
node servers/meta-data-proxy/index.js

Note: run on same server as the rails server

do "netstat -atn | grep 1337" to verify.

e) startup mysql session:
(blue whale console)
mysql -u root -p

f) if you want to lift files via the admin tool some links are:
http://localhost:4200/vrize/lift
http://localhost:4200/vrize/lift-batch

g) Note: ip addresses of the servers are specified in :

$VRGAL/src/app/core/services/core-base.service.ts

Update 2018-04-15: Now they're specified by angular environment files.  I have two : 'sea' and 'val',
depending on your development location.
