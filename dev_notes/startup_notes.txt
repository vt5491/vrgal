ng2 server: 4200
rails server: 3000
express server: 3002

1) How to startup a full environment (including the admin server)

a). cd to $VRGAL and type 'ng serve --host 0.0.0.0'.  This will start the main angular SPA on
port 4200

(black on white console)

b) Start the express server.  cd to $VRGAL and run from the root directory:
(in black on yellow console)

nodemon servers/data-examples/index2.js 

This will be port 3002.  It's the data server that updates the files in the git repo

c) Start the the rails server.  cd to $VRZSRV and run
(green on black console):

rails s

This will start on port 3000, and the server interfaces with the meta-data in the mysql server.

d) startup msql session:
(blue whale console)
mysql -u root -p

e) if you want to lift files via the admin tool some links are:
http://localhost:4200/vrize/lift
http://localhost:4200/vrize/lift-batch

f) Note: ip addresses of the servers are specified in :

$VRGAL/src/app/core/services/core-base.service.ts
