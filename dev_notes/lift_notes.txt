How to lift three.js examples:

1) Select a candidate example in 2-d using the three.js web site (or running locally on port 8000
using $PYSERVE).

Some things to look for a good candidate:
a) Make sure it uses WebGLRender as the renderer and not canvas.
b) Make sure it only uses a PerspectiveCamera and no ortho cameras anywhere (otho cameras
don't stereo-ize)
c) Make sure it has an init() method.

2) I normally lift on my linux image.  Bring up all three servers (vrgal, vrgal-admin, and vrszsrv).

3) cd to $VRGAL/data/examples

4) Copy the candidate example (from three.js github repo)  to here.  Note: you may want to do 'ls | grep "blah"' to see if you've
previously attempted the example:

cp $GH/three.js/examples/webgl_shadowmap_pcss.html . 

5) Set up table 'lift_reqs':

a) to get the example id:
select * from examples where name like '%pcss%';

b) delete any prior lift_reqs:
delete from lift_reqs where id<41;

c) add to lift_reqs:
insert into lift_reqs (example_id) values (181);


6) in browser go to: http://localhost:4200/vrize/lift-batch

Note: the 'write to tmp dir' is checked by default.  This is a good option if you're testing a lift.
If you've previously lifted an example and are re-lifting it for some reason, you may want to uncheck
this and write directly to $VRGAL/src/assets/threejs-env/examples and save yourelf a copy step later.

press 'Batch Lift' button.

7) from tmp dir, cp newly lifted file into to main Ng assets dir:

cp vrize-webgl_shadowmap_pcss.html $VRGAL/src/assets/threejs-env/examples/

8) set the lift_failure_code to -2, so that the sandbox query will pickup on it.

update examples set lift_failure_code=-2 where id=181;

9) Test it on the game pc.  Ok to have a 4200 vrgal on game-pc *and* in linux.

use the sandbox query, becuase it will show all examples with a 'lift_failure_code' of -2.

Also, look at the script and see if you need any additional resources copied.

Note: you do not have to cycle ng server to get new examples.
Note2: no, I think you do.
Yes, the consensus is that you need to cycle the server.  You do if you add a new file under
/assets



10) if the lift fails or is partial, and you don't want to research why:

a)  copy the (failed)
lift from tmp to 'data/lift_fails' or 'data/lift_partials'.

b) Add an entry into table 'lift_fails'

c) Set the lift_score in examples e.g the percent you feel like it failed.

d) set lifted=0 in examples.  The lift_batch sets this flag automatically.  It does not distinguish
between sucessful and unsuccessful lifts.

11) If the lift suceeds:

a) Consider getting a screen shot (of the original threejs example. 
b) set lift_score=100 in examples.
