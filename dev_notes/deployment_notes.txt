1) update git on production an deploying
From infinitewheelie.org $VRGAL dir:

a) git pull

b) ng build --prod

This will put the bundle into "dist" folder.

update: with ng 6+ you should now say:
ng build --configuration=production

Note: I do have an environment=ec2.  However, don't use this, it was just a test
for doing something on ec2.

c) cd /var/www/html/apps/vrgal

sudo rm -rf *

or:
cd $VRGAL_DEPLOY/apps/vrgal

Yes, you need to do this because otherwise you get many version of main and scripts etc.
You may also get into a state where apache doesn't know which version of the build to use.

d) cd dist

e) sudo cp -R * /var/www/html/apps/vrgal

This is a hot deployment.  No need to cycle apache.

Note: Don't forget to update version in package.json so message:

MainComponent.initScene: appVersion=0.8.0

Note: you don't updage MainComponent, just update package.json.


on console.log appears correctly.

f) URL to get to is:
https://infinitewheelie.org/apps/vrgal/

Note: this will drive the default path '' in src/app.module.ts.  'https://infinitewheelie.org/apps/vrgal/vrgal/main' works in development
but not in production.


Note 2: I cannot get UTs to run on dev or on prod.

g) how to start servers:
do a 'crontab -l' to see the commands:

@reboot /bin/bash -l -c 'cd /home/ubuntu/resources/github/vrize-service && rails s --environment=production'
@reboot /bin/bash -l -c 'cd /home/ubuntu/resources/github/vrgal && pm2 start servers/meta-data-proxy/index.js'

h) How to cycle the express (proxy) server:

some useful commands before:

pm2 status
pm2 logs

ps -ef | grep "node"
-> check the pid, so you can verify it changed later.

2) Renewing certificate keys

a) sudo certbot renew --dry-run

remove dry-run for real.  This will create the following:

/etc/letsencrypt/live/infinitewheelie.org/fullchain.pem
/etc/letsencrypt/live/infinitewheelie.org/privkey.pem

b) Don't forget to copy these two pems to the certs dir of the meta-data-proxy (port 1337):

from ~/resources/github/vrgal/servers/meta-data-proxy/certs:

sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/infinitewheelie.org/fullchain.pem ./fullchain2.pem
sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/infinitewheelie.org/privkey.pem ./privkey2.pem

c) use https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html to check:
infinitewheelie.org and infinitewheelier.org:1337

see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52940438/how-to-refresh-ssl-certificate-for-proxy-server-on-port-1337/52941741#52941741

example:
sudo ssl-cert-check -c /etc/letsencrypt/live/infinitewheelie.org/fullchain.pem
