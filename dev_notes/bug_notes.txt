1) Sound doesn't work on firefox period (including nightly).  This is true with OR or Vive.

2) With Chrome:
a) Sound doesn't work with OR
b) It works great with htc vive.

3) Chrome is useless anyway (for my app)
Because it doesn't issue vrdisplayactivate events upon transferring to another web site.  Thus
you keep losing VR.  Transferring to a lifted three.js loses vr.  And if you transfer back
to a-frame, same thing.
