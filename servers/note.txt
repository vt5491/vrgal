This folder is not part of an angular proper.  This is where you should locate node servers that 
need to access the same data as 'threejs-vr-gallery'.  We also have a 'meta-data' server in the 
form of a rail-app in repo 'vrize-service'.  This rails server does *not* need to access the
data in this repo, so it can be separate.  

In here we have the 'examples' service, which is used by the 'vrize' module of VRGAL to read and
lift the examples under 'assets/threejs-env/examples' and then write out new files to the 
same directory.  Thus, this server needs to be tightly coupled to the angular2 client project and
that's why it's included in this repo.
